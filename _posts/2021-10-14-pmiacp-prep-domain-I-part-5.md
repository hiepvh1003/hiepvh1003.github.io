      <h6>Note: Little’s law is an important concept used to help a project team analyze and minimize work in progress when implementing Kanban on an agile project. The law is a mathematical proof developed by John D.C Little that states that the more things you have going at the same time, the longer each thing will take. To understand the formula, let’s break down the different parts of it and describe what each variable means. Cycle time is the time through the progress for each item. Work in progress is the number of items you work on at the same time. Throughput is the average time it takes to complete each item. Cycle time = work in progress / throughput.
The correct answer is: Cycle time = work in progress / throughput</h6>
