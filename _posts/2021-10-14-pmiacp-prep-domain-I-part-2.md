Risk management is a distinct component of traditional project management and teams new to Agile are sometimes concerned that Agile approaches do not address risk management. This is not correct since risk management is built into Agile approaches and are not separate processes and procedures. The short iterations, single-minded focus on working product, hefty emphasis on testing and validation, and frequent customer deliveries help teams manage project risks. [Cohn, M., 2006.
